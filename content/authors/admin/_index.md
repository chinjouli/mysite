I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate at the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University. My fascination with languages led me to the field of computer science, and my research interests revolve around how language technologies can assist humans. I'm also a member of the Translation & Interpreting Program!
