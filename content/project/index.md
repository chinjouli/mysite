This is the final project for Workplace Collaboration in the Digital Age, Fall 2021.

In 2021, NTU introduced the Specialization Program, a new system designed to guide students through course modules and career directions. Certificates are awarded to students upon module completion, serving as evidence of their knowledge gain in a specific field. However, only a few students are aware of this system.

To increase awareness of the Specialization Program, we collaborated with the Center for Teaching and Learning Development & Digital Learning Center. By conducting surveys, interviews, and hosting workshops, more students are now informed about the program. Now, they can more easily make decisions about their courses by exploring potential career plans and selecting modules that align with their interests.
